       "'It was first spotted at Montevrain, 38km (23 miles) east of Paris. Sightings of the animal sparked a search involving hundreds of emergency services workers, animal-trackers and a helicopter. But experts now say the animal is most likely a much less dangerous animal, such as a lynx or large domestic cat. They made their conclusions based on inspecting animal tracks. It remains unclear where the animal came from, though there is a big cat park near Montevrain. A source told AFP that the search had been scaled back for the moment and the helicopter grounded, although forces remained \"mobilised\" in case of a fresh alert. The BBC\\'s Hugh Schofield in Paris says police had suggested there was probably not too much to worry about, but the authorities still sent out officers with guns and tranquilisers. The hunt has focused on areas near the Disneyland Paris theme park. There was a fresh alert on Friday morning after paw prints were discovered near a service station east of Paris. To reach there, the animal had apparently crossed the A4 motorway. Police guarded the entrances to schools in the Montevrain area in case the cat turned up, as a helicopter with thermal imaging hovered. Local residents were asked to stay indoors and parents urged to take their children to and from school by car. A dozen or so soldiers from a nearby army base joined police and fire officials combing the countryside outside Montevrain. A huntsman, officially designated as a \"wolf catcher\", who has a specially trained dog, was also part of the search team. The owner of the lntermarche supermarket in Montevrain said on Thursday that his wife had spotted the animal at about 08:30 (07:30 GMT). \"She didn\\'t get out of the car and called me to say \\'I think I saw a lynx\\',\" he was quoted as saying. The woman took a photograph that appears to show a large cat. Le Parisien newspaper said several local residents had sighted the animal. The Montevrain mayor\\'s office dismissed the idea that the big cat could have escaped from a circus that was in the town until Saturday, Le Parisien reported.'"

       "'summarize: In a statement (in French) it said it was \"worried about the continued worsening of the situation\". On Saturday, Turkey began shelling the militia, which it says is linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The fighters, the YPG militia based in Syria, have rejected Turkey\\'s demand to leave areas it has seized, saying Islamists would return if it left. Turkey\\'s assault is a new thread in an already-complex conflict that has drawn in competing regional powers. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu insisted on Sunday that Turkey \"will not permit the [Kurdish militia] to carry out aggressive acts\". \"Our security forces gave the necessary response and will continue to do so,\" Mr Davutoglu said. Syria has also condemned the Turkish action as a violation of its sovereignty and asked the UN Security Council to intervene. France also called on the Syrian regime and its allies to stop their bombardments \"across the whole of the country\". France said priority should be given to implementing an agreement reached in Munich this week on ceasing hostilities, and the fight against so-called Islamic State (IS) group. Almost five years of civil war in Syria have led to the deaths of more than 250,000 people. More than 11 million people have been displaced. How Putin is succeeding in Syria Displaced Syrians struggle to survive Syria: The story of the conflict Turkey v Islamic State v the Kurds: What\\'s going on? Attempts to broker a peace deal have repeatedly failed, but on Thursday, world leaders agreed to work towards a so-called cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week. The US and Russian presidents agreed in a \"frank and business-like\" phone call to work more closely to achieve this, the Kremlin said on Sunday. Russia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has been carrying out air strikes since September against what it terms \"terrorists\". Among the targets shelled by Turkey is the Menagh airbase, which was seized by the YPG on Thursday from Syrian Islamist rebels. The YPG controls much of Syria\\'s northern border with Turkey. Syria\\'s war hardly needs a new front, but another has now opened up. Ankara sees the Kurdish PYD party and its YPG militia as terrorist organisations. It\\'s worried that weapons are seeping over the border from Syria to the PKK, with which Turkey has renewed its armed conflict since a ceasefire broke down last year. Washington rejects Ankara\\'s view that the PYD is a terrorist organisation, seeing it instead as an effective ally against so-called Islamic State (IS). That has caused rifts between the two Nato allies and is hampering international peace talks. Syria is the stage for several proxy wars, and Turkey has just started another, going after its Kurdish nemesis there and vowing to stop the PYD from cementing control of northern Syria. Turkey\\'s state-run Anadolu Agency said Turkish forces shot at Kurdish fighters inside Syria on Sunday after coming under fire themselves. Ankara sees the group as being linked with Kurdish guerrillas from PKK, which has waged a campaign against security forces in Turkey for decades. In other developments: Under the agreed cessation of hostilities plan, efforts will be made to try to make urgent aid deliveries to besieged and hard-to-reach areas in Syria. Steps will also be taken to work towards an eventual ceasefire and implementation of a UN-backed plan for political transition in Syria. The halt would not apply to the battle against the jihadists of IS and al-Nusra Front. However, neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved in the deal and both have since vowed to continue fighting. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said on Friday that he intended to retake \"the whole country\" from rebels - a statement the US government said was \"deluded\". Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, have almost encircled rebels in parts of the northern city of Aleppo. Also on Sunday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev repeated a warning that any foreign ground operation in Syria would lead to \"a full-fledged, long war\". Turkey has said its troops and forces from Saudi Arabia might participate in a ground operation against IS.'"

However a number of pre-conditions would need to be met before a draft lease could be agreed, at the authority\\'s February meeting. The B-listed Edwardian building has sat empty since it closed 10 years ago. Councillors deferred a decision on which development bid to back, if any, in July, calling for further reports from Historic Scotland and other agencies and further information from the applicants. At that stage, council officials had backed the view of independent property specialists Jones Laing LaSalle that the Perth Market Place Ltd proposal should be preferred to the hotel bid from the Seventy Group. A report to councillors ahead of Wednesday\\'s full council meeting noted that \"there has been a change in circumstances which significantly impacts upon the Seventy Group\\'s bid\", meaning no further information could be provided. Planning and development head David Littlejohn has asked councillors to give the marketplace proposal \"preferred bidder status\" to allow detailed negotiations to take place. Should this happen, a draft lease could potentially be considered by the council in February 2016, although this would also have to be signed off by the Perth Common Good Fund Committee. The Edwardian building, which dates back to 1911, was closed 10 years ago after a modern new concert hall was opened in the city. Decisions over its future have been drawn out over a decade since then, with councillors at one point approving plans to have it demolished, which were subsequently blocked by Historic Scotland opposition. The development management committee then backed the Seventy Group plans to convert it into a luxury hotel, before councillors agreed to publicly market a 125-year lease on the building to find an alternative to demolition. Five bids were submitted in January, which where whittled down to two by July when councillors deferred the decision. Should neither bid ultimately win approval, demolition could still be an option, although Historic Scotland chief executive Ian Walford warned he would be minded to object to such a move. Mr Littlejohn also noted in his report that Historic Scotland had underlined that \"the process cannot be allowed to perpetuate\", and that a decision will have to be made.'"

       "'summarize: The Oil and Gas Technology Centre will partly fund the work while also acting as a bridge between small tech firms and the big oil producers. The industry said research projects have recently been neglected. It said this happened after many production platforms were sold by the big oil majors to much smaller firms. Oil supply company Mistras has been developing technology more commonly used to enable expectant mothers to see their babies. The ultrasound scanners, complete with cold jelly, are being used to detect corrosion in pipes. The Dyce-based company hopes the technology centre will help them get their product to new customers. Managing director Tim Walsh said: \"What we are hoping and expecting from the technology centre is that it will allow us as an organisation that has solutions to particular problems that we know exist to get a better connection with end users and clients and get more traction. \"We want them to allow us to take them out into the field, give us the opportunity to demonstrate to potential clients that the technology works and that the technology can actually allow them to do what we want them to do.\" The Oil and Gas Technology centre will invest in small firms with solid ideas and help pair some of those developers with the offshore operators that need them. Chief executive Colette Cohen said: \"We have much more operators in the north sea now, I think it\\'s about 60 operators whereas back in the 80s it was about five or six, so it is a hugely different world. \"Those smaller operators don\\'t have a technology organisation. They\\'re not big enough and they can\\'t support that, it wouldn\\'t be economic. \"So this is a time when we can provide that service to them.\" The new centre will build on the existing work being carried out by Aberdeen\\'s two universities. At Robert Gordon University they have a drilling-rig simulator where they train students and refresh the skills of those in the industry. They will now be able to incorporate new technologies into their models to see if they work effectively. Prof Phil Hassard said: \"They\\'ll be able to get the results back from that... they can be tested here and are more cost effective than trying to do it on a real rig.\" The centre\\'s conception stems from the principles of Sir Ian Wood\\'s report into maximising economic recovery in the North Sea. The oil tycoon was one of the invited guests at the official opening.'"

       "'It was first spotted at Montevrain, 38km (23 miles) east of Paris. Sightings of the animal sparked a search involving hundreds of emergency services workers, animal-trackers and a helicopter. But experts now say the animal is most likely a much less dangerous animal, such as a lynx or large domestic cat. They made their conclusions based on inspecting animal tracks. It remains unclear where the animal came from, though there is a big cat park near Montevrain. A source told AFP that the search had been scaled back for the moment and the helicopter grounded, although forces remained \"mobilised\" in case of a fresh alert. The BBC\\'s Hugh Schofield in Paris says police had suggested there was probably not too much to worry about, but the authorities still sent out officers with guns and tranquilisers. The hunt has focused on areas near the Disneyland Paris theme park. There was a fresh alert on Friday morning after paw prints were discovered near a service station east of Paris. To reach there, the animal had apparently crossed the A4 motorway. Police guarded the entrances to schools in the Montevrain area in case the cat turned up, as a helicopter with thermal imaging hovered. Local residents were asked to stay indoors and parents urged to take their children to and from school by car. A dozen or so soldiers from a nearby army base joined police and fire officials combing the countryside outside Montevrain. A huntsman, officially designated as a \"wolf catcher\", who has a specially trained dog, was also part of the search team. The owner of the lntermarche supermarket in Montevrain said on Thursday that his wife had spotted the animal at about 08:30 (07:30 GMT). \"She didn\\'t get out of the car and called me to say \\'I think I saw a lynx\\',\" he was quoted as saying. The woman took a photograph that appears to show a large cat. Le Parisien newspaper said several local residents had sighted the animal. The Montevrain mayor\\'s office dismissed the idea that the big cat could have escaped from a circus that was in the town until Saturday, Le Parisien reported.'"
